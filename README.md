# sql_assignment_2
- At start i created 3 tables and inserted them(1000000 rows) with help of python code
- Created non-optimized query 
- In non_optimized query was such problems:
  - Subqueries
  - complex average calculation
  - bad structer
  - no indexes
- After this i created CTE, to replace suqbqueries and did average calculation easier
- added indexes
